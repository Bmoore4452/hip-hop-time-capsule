She was my co-worker at iHeartMedia, and she is a good friend of mine. She is one of the kindest and most generous people I know. She is also a Hip-Hop legend. Here is a little research on Lisa G.\n\nShe was a prominent radio personality and co-host on Hot 97's morning show with Ed Lover and Dr. Dre in the 1990s. It was one of the first Hip-Hop Morning Shows on an all Hip-Hop format. She played an essential role in the early days of mainstream Hip-Hop radio, helping to bring rap music and culture to a wider audience. This show helped shape Hip-Hop radio, blending humor, music, and interviews with some of the biggest rap stars of the time. Many listeners assumed she was black because her voice and style fit seamlessly with the culture. She was well respected for her work and authenticity. Her time on Hot 97, solidified her place in Hip-Hop history. ***Love you Lisa G. Proud to know you! Anita"
